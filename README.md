# Quantum protocols for few qubit devices

This is the PhD dissertation by Koen Groenland, titled Quantum Protocols for Few Qubit Devices. The repository contains two things:
1. My PhD thesis as .pdf
2. All `LaTeX` code and figures used to generate the document

To simply view the thesis, take a look at 
`thesis_digital_191203.pdf` (for viewing on a computer screen) and `thesis_print_191203.pdf` (for printing, including cut marks).


For those searching for inspiration or technical aid in setting up a thesis, my .tex files can be inspected. 

`thesis.tex` is the main document. It imports parts of several other documents, such as:
- `markup.tex`, which contains information specific to the looks. It can be safely omitted, and one can safely experiment with other markup. 
- `markup_print.tex` is used only when generating a PDF meant for printing (with cut marks and CMYK colors). 
- The various folders contain the different chapters and figures therein. 
- `thesis.bbl` is the bibliography file, as generated by BibLaTeX. Sorry, I'm not showing my messy .bib databases! 

### Some things I would have done differently:
Based on N=1 experience with a peer's printing company, I thought printers prefered to receive an A4 format thesis (with large font), allowing the printer to shrink the pages to the right size. 
 
I believe the for most printers (including mine: NBD Biblion), the proper Dutch Thesis page size is expected (17 x 24 cm), including some X cm extra spacing around each page for cutting. I'd recommend to set the right page size from the start: this avoids tedious rescaling later. 

Adding cut marks is easy with the package `crop` (see `markup_print.tex`). I had to tediously use rescaled margins, but you don't have to :). 
 
 
 ### All documents can be used freely. Please cite me as:
